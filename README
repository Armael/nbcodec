nbcodec
-------

In `src` there are two implementations of a streaming codec for
simplified ASCII s-expressions.

* `Se.B` implements a (conceptually) blocking codec: for decoding data
  is pulled from the source and for encoding data is pushed to the
  destination.

* `Se.Nb` implements a non-blocking codec: for decoding data is pushed
  to the decoder and for encoding data is pulled from the decoder.

The api documentation can be generated with 

    ./build doc

the result is in `_build/doc/api.docdir/Se.html`. 

In `test` there are a few executables that can be used to test the
codecs. They can be built with

    ./build tests.otarget

Invoke the utilitites with -help for more information.
