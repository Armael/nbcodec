(** Blocking and non-blocking streaming codecs for simplified s-expressions. 

    We want to encode and decode the following simple s-expression grammar
    (expressed in the language of 
    {{:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234}RFC 5234}).
{[
  doc = *sexp
 sexp = white / atom / list
white =  *( %x0020 / %x0009 / %x000A / %x000D )
 list =  %x0028 *sexp %x0029
 atom = *( %x0021-0027 / %x0030-007E ) ; most ASCII printable characters 
]} 
    This corresponds s-expressions without quoted tokens and
    comments. We assume an ASCII encoding.

    The module {!Se.B} is a blocking streaming codec for this grammar while
    {!Se.Nb} is a non-blocking streaming one.
*)

(** {1 Data model} *)

type lexeme = [ `Ls | `Le | `A of string ]
(** The type for s-expression lexemes. Atoms, list end and list start.

    A well-formed sequence of lexemes belongs to the language
    of the [doc] grammar : 
{[
doc = *sexp 
sexp = `A a / `Ls *sexp `Le 
]} 
    The codecs deal only with well-formed sequences or
    errors are returned. They also assume that the atom strings
    are immutable.
